## Introduction

This repository contains a series of JavaScript examples and explanations to help you understand and master JavaScript. Currently, we are focusing on variables.

## Variables in JavaScript

### Variable Declaration

In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Each keyword has different properties and behaviors.

- **var**: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- **let**: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- **const**: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

### Variable Scope

- **Global Scope**: A variable declared outside any function or block has a global scope.
- **Function Scope**: A variable declared within a function has a local scope, accessible only within that function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block (a pair of curly braces `{}`) are block-scoped.

### Variable Hoisting

- **var**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope and can be used before declaration (though they will be `undefined` until assigned).
- **let** and **const**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError`.

### Constant Variables

Variables declared with `const` are read-only. They cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. However, if the variable is an object or array, the contents can be modified.

### Implicit Global Variables

When you declare a variable without using `var`, `let`, or `const`, it is implicitly created as a global variable. This can lead to unintended consequences and is generally considered bad practice. Here’s why:

1. **Global Scope**: The variable is added to the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers), which means it can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the code, potentially leading to conflicts and bugs.
2. **No Block Scope**: Unlike `let` and `const`, which are block-scoped, and `var`, which is function-scoped, an implicitly declared variable is globally scoped, which can lead to unpredictable behavior in larger codebases.
3. **Lack of Strict Mode Compliance**: In strict mode (`'use strict';`), this will throw an error, enforcing better coding practices and reducing the likelihood of bugs.

### Examples

Here's an example of variable declaration and reassignment:

```javascript
const accountId = 144553;
let email = "sk.a.hakeem123@gmail.com";
var accountPassword = "12345";
let accountCity = "Jaipur";

// accountId = 2; // not allowed because it's a constant

email = "abc@gmail.com";
accountPassword = "2323432";
accountCity = "Manipur";

console.table([accountId, email, accountPassword, accountCity]);
```

### This script will output a table with the following values:

```
┌─────────┬─────────────────┐
│ (index) │ Values          │
├─────────┼─────────────────┤
│ 0       │ 144553          │
│ 1       │ 'abc@gmail.com' │
│ 2       │ '2323432'       │
│ 3       │ 'Manipur'       │
└─────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Exercises

Here are some exercises to practice your understanding of JavaScript variables:

1. **Basic Variable Declaration**
   - Declare three variables: `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`. Assign appropriate values to them and log them to the console.

```
<details>
  <summary>Show Solution</summary>
   ```javascript
   let name = "John Doe";
   let age = 25;
   let isStudent = true;

   console.log(name, age, isStudent);
   ```
</details>
```
2. **Variable Reassignment**
   - Declare a variable `color` using `let` and assign it a value. Reassign the value of `color` and log the result to the console.

   ```javascript
   let color = "blue";
   color = "green";
   console.log(color);
   ```

3. **Using `const`**
   - Declare a constant `PI` with the value `3.14`. Try reassigning `PI` and observe what happens.

   ```javascript
   const PI = 3.14;
   // PI = 3.14159; // This will cause an error
   console.log(PI);
   ```

4. **Scope Exercise**
   - Declare a variable inside a function and try accessing it outside the function. Observe what happens.

   ```javascript
   function testScope() {
       let localVar = "I am local";
       console.log(localVar);
   }

   testScope();
   // console.log(localVar); // Uncommenting this will cause an error
   ```

5. **Implicit Global Variable**
   - Declare a variable without using `var`, `let`, or `const` inside a function. Observe if it becomes a global variable.

   ```javascript
   function createGlobalVar() {
       implicitGlobal = "I am global";
   }

   createGlobalVar();
   console.log(implicitGlobal); // Should log "I am global"
   ```

## How to Run

To run the `variables.js` file, you need to have Node.js installed. Use the following command:

```bash
node variables.js
```
